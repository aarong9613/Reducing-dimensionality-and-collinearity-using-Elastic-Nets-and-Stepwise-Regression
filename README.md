# Reducing-dimensionality-and-collinearity-using-Elastic-Nets-and-Stepwise-Regression
By reducing collinearity and dimensionality for data sets with small quantities of data, overfitting can be reduced. As a result the trained model will likely perform better on unseen data sets than a model with more variables and redundancy.
